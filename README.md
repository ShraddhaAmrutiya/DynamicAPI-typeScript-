# DynamicAPI-typeScript-
This TypeScript-based API implements JWT authentication and dynamic management of modules, permissions, and user groups. It allows creating modules, assigning permissions to them, and managing user groups with associated permissions, all while maintaining secure, role-based authorization. Using TypeScript ensures type safety and improved development experience, making the API highly maintainable and scalable. Key features include token-based authentication, dynamic permission handling, group and user management, and secure access control using middleware to check user permissions. This API is built to be robust, with extensive validation, logging, and best security practices.
